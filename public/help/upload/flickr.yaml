          You must now annotate your photo with the metadata required by NatureShare.
          Click on "Add a description".
          Add the structured text that describes your photo.
          The description must start with "--- #natureshare.org".
          Id, description and tags are *not* required. For example, if you do not know the id (species), remove that line from the description.
          License *is* required and must be set to "CC BY 4.0" as NatureShare is all about sharing and only accepts openly licensed content.
          For assistance creating the metadata text, please go to:
          https://natureshare.org.au/metadata
          Here is an example description:
        code: |
          --- #natureshare.org
          id: [Ranoidea citropa]
          description: Small frog found on a track in Blue Mountains NP
          collections: [blue_mountains_np]
          tags: [frogs]

  - title: Grouping Photos
    steps:
      - text: |
            Sometimes you may have more than one photo for the same specimen, at the same place and time.
            It is easy to group them in to the same observation item.
      - title: Set the Title
        image: /help/upload/flickr/group.png
        text: |
            To group a set of photos, give them all the same title.
            Then, set the order of the photos by adding "~" (tilde) and a number at the end of each title.
            For example, three photos would have the titles: "filename", "filename~2" and "filename~3".
            (The tilde can be found near the top-left of most keyboards.)
            Note, only the first photo must have the NatureShare metadata description.
      - title: On Your Computer
        text: |
            When you upload photos to Flickr, the original filename will be used as the title.
            This means you can save some by first renaming the files on your computer or camera, before uploading them.

  - title: Sync
    steps:
      - title: Request a NatureShare update.

          Click on the "SYNC NOW" button.
      - title: Please Wait
        text: |
          Sync runs once per hour and can be a slow process.
          Your computer may also cache this website for up to one day.
          Please return later to see your photos appear on NatureShare.
