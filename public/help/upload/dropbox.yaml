          On the upload page (found the in side menu), click the CONNECT button for Dropbox.
          You will then be redirected to the *official* Dropbox website.

        text: |
            Authorise the app.
            Note, NatureShare will not have access to any of your existing Dropbox files.
            When you authorise the NatureShare app a new Apps folder will be created.
            You must put the files you want NatureShare to access only in that folder. (See below.)
      - title: Return
        text: You will then be redirected back to the NatureShare uploads page.

    steps:
      - title: Apps Folder
        image: ./dropbox/folder_apps.png
        text: |
          A new folder will have been created under your Dropbox account called "Apps".
          Use the web browser or desktop integration to find it.
      - title: NatureShare folder
        image: ./dropbox/folder_ns.png
        text: Inside the "Apps" folder is a new folder titled "NatureShare"
      - title: Subfolder
        image: ./dropbox/folder_year.png
        text: |
          Inside the "NatureShare" folder, please create one or more new folders for your photos.
          I recommend creating one folder per year, but you can use anything name like (eg "frogs"), as long as you keep it short and only used letters and numbers.
      - title: Upload
        image: ./dropbox/folder_content.png
        text: |
          Drag and drop your photo files to the new folder.
          Note, only one level of sub-folder is allowed inside the "NatureShare" folder.
      - title: Text files
        image: ./dropbox/textfile.png
        text: |
          You must now annotate your photos with the metadata required by NatureShare.
          Each photo (or group of photos) must have a text file (.txt) with the same name as the photo file.
          Add the structured text that describes your photo to this file.
          You can create this file on your computer with Notepad or TextEdit and save it along side your photos.
      - title: Metadata
        text: |
          The content of the text file must start with "--- #natureshare.org".
          Id, description and tags are *not* required. For example, if you do not know the id (species), remove that line from the file.
          License *is* required and must be set to "CC BY 4.0" as NatureShare is all about sharing and only accepts openly licensed content.
          For assistance creating the metadata text, please go to:
          https://natureshare.org.au/metadata
          Here is an example file:
        code: |
          --- #natureshare.org
          id: [Ranoidea citropa]
          description: Small frog found on a track in Blue Mountains NP
          collections: [blue_mountains_np]
          tags: [frog]
          license: CC BY 4.0
  - title: Grouping Photos
    steps:
      - text: |
            Sometimes you may have more than one photo for the same specimen, at the same place and time.
            It is easy to group them in to the same observation item.
      - title: Set the Filenames
        image: ./dropbox/groups.png
        text: |
            To group a set of photos, give them all the same filename.
            Then, set the order of the photos by adding "~" (tilde) and a number at the end of each name.
            For example, three photo files would have the names: "filename", "filename~2" and "filename~3".
            (The tilde can be found near the top-left of most keyboards.)
            Note, only create one text file for the group.
      - title: On Your Computer
        text: |
            Tip: Keep your photo files organised on your own computer and then automatically sync them to Dropbox with the Dropbox app.

  - title: NatureShare Sync
    steps:
      - title: Request a NatureShare update.
        image: ./dropbox/sync_now.png
        text: |
          When you are finished uploading files, return to to NatureShare upload page.
          Click on the "SYNC NOW" button.
      - title: Please Wait
        text: |
          Sync runs once per hour and can be a slow process.
          Your computer may also cache this website for up to one day, preventing you from seeing new updates.
          Please return later to see your photos appear on NatureShare.
