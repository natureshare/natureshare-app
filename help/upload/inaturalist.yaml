            iNaturalist is one of the worldâ€™s most popular nature apps and is great for identifying plants and animals.

            https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/about

            Upon sync, your NatureShare records will be submitted to iNaturalist as observations. Photos are uploaded (but not video nor audio) and only the primary (first) identification of each record can be transferred.

            Observations under your iNaturalist account will be imported to your NatureShare dataset as plain-text YAML files and indexed as standards-compliant JSONFeed, GeoJSON, Atom and RSS files. Note, photos are not downloaded - a link is created to the original file stored on the iNaturalist servers.

            To avoid flooding the iNaturalist API, uploads are currently limited to 100 observations per sync.

            Only photo thumbnail sizes (not the originals) are uploaded to reduce the load on iNaturalist servers. A link (href) is created back to your original item page on NatureShare.org.
