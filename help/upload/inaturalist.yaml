            iNaturalist is one of the worldâ€™s most popular nature apps and is great for identifying the plants and animals around you.

            https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/about

            Upon sync, your NatureShare item records will be uploaded to iNaturalist as observations. Photo thumbnails are uploaded (no audio or video) and only the primary (first) identification is transferred.

            Observations under your iNaturalist account will be imported to the NatureShare dataset as plain-text YAML files and indexed as standards-compliant JSONFeed, GeoJSON, Atom and RSS files. Note, photos are not downloaded - a link is created to the original file stored on the iNaturalist servers.

            To avoid flooding the iNaturalist API, imports are limited to 1000 items per sync and uploads are currently limited to 50 observations per sync.

            Only thumbnails photo sizes (not the originals) are uploaded to reduce the load on iNaturalist servers. A link is created back to your original item on NatureShare.org.
