          NatureShare is designed as a distributed and decentralised sharing hub.

          This means you can choose where in the "cloud" your photos and data are stored and maintained.

          So far there is support for automatic sync with your iNaturalist, Flickr, Dropbox, Google Photos and YouTube accounts. (More available soon!)

          In addition, you can upload your photos to anywhere on the public web (eg, a blog or FTP server) and link them in to NatureShare.

          This means you stay in control of your files without needing to rely on any one big, centralised website or database. You can even create a mirror (aka backup) of this entire NatureShare website on your own domain name, easily and **for free!**
