(More available soon!)\n\nIn addition, you can upload your photos to anywhere on the public web (eg, a blog or FTP server) and link them in to NatureShare.\n\nThis means you stay in control of your files without needing to rely on any one big, centralised website or database. You can even create a mirror (aka backup) of this entire NatureShare website on your own domain name, easily and **for free!**\n"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
